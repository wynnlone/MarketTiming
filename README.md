# MarketTiming

Testing some of the technical market timing strategies on different stocks and indices.

Mainly testing double moving averages (set short parameter 1 to test single moving average). Recently experimented with the US 10-year T-bill rate as an external indicator according to a research paper but the performance was unsatisfactory.

Please see output for testing results and image for visual
