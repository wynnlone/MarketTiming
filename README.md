# MarketTiming

Testing some of the technical market timing strategy on different stocks and indices.

Mainly testing double moving averages (set ma_short=1 to test single moving average). Recently experimented with US 10-year T-bill rate as an external indicator according to a research paper but the performance was unsatisfactory.
